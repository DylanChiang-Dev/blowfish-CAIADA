## Foreword

Artificial Intelligence is a strategic technology leading the new round of scientific and technological revolution and industrial transformation. The 2025 "Government Work Report" of Mainland China proposed to continuously promote the "AI+" action. In this context, the China Internet Network Information Center (CNNIC) released the "Development Report on Generative AI Applications (2025)", analyzing the current status of generative AI applications and development in Mainland China and globally.

## Chapter 1: Key Characteristics of Generative AI Development

### 1. Fruitful Achievements in Mainland China's AI
As of June 2025, Mainland China's generative AI user base reached **515 million**, with a penetration rate of **36.5%**. By the end of August, a total of **538 generative AI services** had completed registration. Notably, products like **DeepSeek** have gained significant international attention. DeepSeek-R1, with its excellent performance and extremely low cost, has become the world's fastest-growing generative AI application.

### 2. Significant Improvement in Logical Reasoning
The scale of model parameters continues to expand (GPT-4 estimated at 1.76 trillion), and architectural designs are being optimized (e.g., Mixture of Experts, MoE), leading to outstanding performance in multi-turn dialogues, code generation, and complex reasoning tasks.

### 3. Leapfrog Development in Multi-modal Capabilities
Transitioning from single-text to any combination of text, audio, image, and video input/output. Models such as OpenAI's Sora, Kuaishou's "Keling 2.0", and Alibaba Cloud's "Tongyi Wanxiang" have significantly lowered the barriers to content creation.

### 4. Significant Reduction in Inference Costs and Lightweighting
Inference costs have dropped by more than **280 times** in two years. Companies are launching lightweight models (e.g., "Ziyue 3 Mathematics Model"), pushing AI from the cloud to the edge (mobile phones, IoT devices).

## Chapter 4: Future Outlook

1. **Model Integration**: Unified system designs like GPT-5 will automatically switch reasoning modes based on needs.
2. **Open Source Communities**: Platforms like GitHub and Hugging Face provide new impetus for technological progress.
3. **Embodied AI**: The combination of robotics and generative AI will lead to more human-like interactive experiences.
4. **AI Agents**: Shifting from "interaction" to "execution," capable of independently operating computers to complete complex tasks.
